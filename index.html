    <title>Pitching Excercise</title>

        <h1>Pitching Exercises</h1>
        <br>
        <h5>These are some excercises that I think would help you with your arm strength as well as accuracy. You can do these drills against a wall with a tennis ball or with a partner with a regular baseball. These drills are a progression, so I would reccommend doing these in order to get the most out of it.</h5>
        <br>
        <h5>Depending on how you feel you can pick and choose on what drills you want to do. If you feel good, I would try to do everything. If you're sore I would do some drills, play light catch and skip the flat ground. You can also change the number of throws you do for each drill. A lot of it is also figuring out what works and which drills you think helps you the most.</h5>
        <br>
        <h5>MAKE SURE TO TRY TO DO SOME SORT OF WARM UP BEFORE YOU THROW. GET YOUR BODY TEMP UP.</h5>
        <br>
        <h3>Cues to Remember</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Be Athletic, almost like you're a quarterback.</li>
            <li>Try to keep the angle between your bicep and forarm at 90 degrees or a little under.</li>
            <li>Don't worry about getting your arm up, it should automatically go up.</li>
            <li>Again, be <strong>ATHLETIC</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <br>

                <li>You can do this by someone tossing you the ball and you trying to thow it as quick as possible like you're turning a "double play" or you can throw the ball up and catch and throw it really quick.</li>
