        <h1>Pitching Exercises</h1>
        <br>
        <h5>These are some excercises that I think would help you with your arm strength as well as accuracy. You can do these drills against a wall with a tennis ball or with a partner. Once you get used to the motions, it might be benificial to even borrow a softball from Nicole just for the drill part. These drills are a progression, so I would reccommend doing these in order to get the most out of it.</h5>

        <h3>Cues to Remember</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Be Athletic, almost like you're a quarterback.</li>
            <li>Try to keep the angle between your bicep and forarm at 90 degrees or a little under.</li>
            <li>Don't worry about getting your arm up, it should automatically go up.</li>
            <li>Again, be <strong>ATHLETIC</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <h3><li>Kneeling Throws</li></h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Do 5 - 10 throws</li>
                <li>Before each throw, make sure to see that the angle between your bicep and forearm is around 90 degrees.</li>
                <li>Follow through with your throw</li>
            </ul>
            <br>

            <img src="style/images/Standing.gif"  alt=”standing” />
            <ul>
                <li>Do 5 - 10 throws</li>
                <li>If you look closely when he takes out the ball, he does a row motion where the elbow retracts back. Emphasize this part.</li>
                <li>Once you get the hang of this, try to be smooth and fluid with your motion. Your arm should not pause or stop.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3><li>Walking Backwards Throws</li></h3>

                <li>Do 5 - 10 throws</li>
                <li>This is similar to the previous drill, but walking backwards.</li>
                <li>Try to keep on walking while you throw.</li>
                <li>Emphasize being fluid and the 90 degree rowing motion.</li>

                <li>This incorporates the previous excercise, but now we are adding in a throw going forward</li>
                <li>Try to get some sort of rhythm when you throw. Remember be athletic. Think you're a quarter back.</li>
                <li>Emphasize being fluid and the 90 degree rowing motion.</li>
